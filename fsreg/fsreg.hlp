  Description
  -----------

^fsreg^ performs the forward search regression, and ^fsregrph^ displays the 
results graphically, as given by Riani & Atkinson (2000). (Their concern was
the choice of the parameter for Box-Cox transformation, which is known to
be sensitive to outliers, either in the initial variables, or in transformed
variables.)

^fsreg^ attempts to find the sets of observations that do not seem to have 
outliers by initially selecting and carefully extending an outlier-free set. 
The initial set is chosen via Stata's robust regression, see help for @rreg@. 
Better theoretical alternatives are possible, e.g. least median error 
regressions ibid. A small number of observations (something like 10% of the 
whole sample) with the smallest absolute value of the residuals from this 
regression are chosen to be the initial data set. Then at each stage the 
regression is re-estimated with the current sample, and the observations that 
have the smallest residuals in the current regression are added.

Some diagnostic data is collected on the way. ^fsregrph^ displays the
diagnostic plots. Usually, the outliers are added at the very end of the search
process, which is evidenced by sharp jumps or drops on the graphs.


  Options of ^fsreg^
  ----------------

^clear^ is not optional. It indicates your understanding that the current data
        is going to be destroyed, unless you @save@d or @preserve@d them, and 
        replaced by the diagnostic data.

^saving^ specifies the name of the file to save the diagnostic data. If not 
        provided, the default name ^FSRegData.dta^ will be used.

^replace^ tells to re-write the diagnostic data file if the file under the
        ^saving^ option already exists.

^id^ can be used to provide a sort of identifier for the observations. If not
        specified, the observation number in the original data file will be
        used. This should be treated with some caution, as long as this number
        will change depending on how the data set is sorted.

^residuals^ allows to collect information on a number of the greatest residuals
        as determined by the initial robust regression. These are likely to be
        unusual observations, so it might be useful to trace them. If there is
        a serious need of the variable transformation, however, then these 
        residuals may not be informative. A two-stage procedure can be 
        suggested: first, the ^fsreg^ is run without specifying any residuals,
        and then once again tracing the residuals for selected observations;
        see ^obs^ option and the explanation of the diagnostic file structure
        below. Absolute values of residuals are written into the diagnostics 
        file.

^rstudent^ and ^rstandard^ can be used to trace the studentized and standardized
        residuals instead of the usual ones. The shorthands follow the ^predict^ 
        options for @regress@. ^rstudent^ tends to produce spiky plots, as Stata
        sometimes calculates the studentized residual to be zero if the 
        observation is not in the estimation sample.

^nres^ specifies how many residuals should be traced.

^obs^ allows to specify the list of suspect observations to be traced. Some sort
        of residuals should be specified along with ^obs^.

^initial^ gives the size of the initial outlier-free set.

^dots^ entertains the user by displaying a dot for each added observation and
        providing other additional information.


  Options of ^fsregrph^
  -------------------

^score^ graphs the score tests for Box-Cox transformations with lambdas equal
       to -2.0, -1.0, -0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0.

^betas^ displays how the coefficients estimates change as observations are
       added to the model. The variables you are interested in should be listed
       in the parentheses.

^b^ is a shorthand for ^betas^ will all regressors included.

^tstats^ displays how the t-statistics of the regressors change as observations 
       are added to the model. The variables you are interested in should be 
       listed in the parentheses.

^t^ is a shorthand for ^tstats^ with all regressors included.

^residual^ displays the (usual, studentized, or standardized) residuals
       if the relevant information is present.

^level^ specifies the confidence levels for the confidence intervals. The 
       default is Stata's $S_level; see help for @level@.


  Diagnostic data file
  --------------------

^fsreg^ creates the diagnostic data file of a certain structure. Some 
explanations follow, although all variables are labelled.

^_nobs^ is the variable that shows the current number of observations.
^_added^ is the ID (or just the number) of the observation that is to be added
        at the next step. If more than one observation was added into 
        the "outlier free" set (and, respectively, one or more observations
        dropped out of it. It might well be happening at the early stages
        if the initial set is not really optimal), then this variable is 
        set to missing. It is also missing in the last point, as there is
        nothing more to add.
^varlist^ specified in the call to ^fsreg^ are the regression coefficients
        at the current step.
^_t*^ are t-statistics of the regressors at the current step.
^_sigma2^ is the mean squared error of the current regression. As observations
        with larger and larger residuals are added, the MSE grows steadily,
        but might jump up if a serious outlier is added at this step.
^_sco*^ variables are score tests for Box-Cox's lambda -2, -1, -0.5, 0, 0.5, 1
        and 2.
^_r*^ variables, if any, are residuals identified by ID or observation number.
^_lab*^ are labels for scores graphs.

This sequence looks at the 2000 US presidential election for Florida. The first
regression is a naive way to understand whether the number of votes for
Buchanan is unusually high in Palm Beach county. Some people go further than
that and say, "Such and such many votes should go to Gore rather than to
Buchanan." The first objection to this simple regression would be heterogeneity
of the data. The counties differ by size tremendously (you can check that with
the data). So, we could look for the transformation of the data that would 
improve upon it. One of possible (family of) transformations is Box-Cox 
transformation, and we will be having a look at the suggested parameter within 
the ^fsreg^ framework. The graph of the scores of several Box-Cox transformation
parameters is produced by default as the result of ^fsreg^ procedure.

We see on the graph produced by ^fsreg^ that the observation added at the last
step is a large positive outlier. It has no influence on the scores for the 
Box-Cox parameters less than zero (i.e. the transformations that make large
values small), but it does affect the scores for the positive values of the 
parameter. The models that retain this observation large or make it even larger 
do not fit the data well, so the score tests for lambda are unsatisfactory. 
Listing the numbers of the added observations reveals that this is in fact 
Palm Beach county. It should also be noted that the observation added at 
step 44 is likely to be unusually small (this turns out to be Lafayette 
county): the scores that are sensitive to small numbers jump away from zero 
at this point.

So, good parameters for Box-Cox transformation lie between 0 and 0.5 for almost
all subsets of the Florida election data set. Both these values do make sense 
if one believes that the data follow Poisson distribution. The value of 0
gives the canonical link, while the square root transformation is approximately
variance stabilizing.
